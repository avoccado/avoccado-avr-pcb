(prerequisites)
(1. need a working probe)
(2. tool needs to be within 10mm of copper board for the 1st probe, )
(i.e. Z0.000 should be no more than 10mm above the board initially)
(Note: The first probe will touch off Z to 0.000 when it first touches to copper, )
(all other probe values are relative to this first point)

G21 (millimeters)
G90 (absolute distance mode, not incremental)

(begin initial probe and set Z to 0)

(Set S value to ensure Speed has a value otherwise the spindle will not start on an M3 command)
S20000

(The program will pause to allow the probe to be detached)
(press cycle start to resume from current line)

(The original mill file is now rewritten with z depth replaced with a)
